## IRIS 概览

> IRIS为了纪念希腊神话中的彩虹女神，她是她是天堂和人间忠诚的信使。 

契约关系是人类社会的一个基本组成部分，区块链技术的重要性在于提供一种实现可靠合同关系的非常有效和成本有效的方式：首先，当多方参与复杂的业务交互时不需要信任（这也是非常宝贵的）。 我们认为区块链技术为分布式业务提供了最重要的元素：提升网络效益和极低的交易成本。越来越多的人认识到区块链作为新的价值互联网的潜力，并将逐渐将当前的商业模式转变为更高效的分布式商业模式。 特别是大多数现代区块链中嵌入的通证机制强调每个网络参与者的权利，并会革新其当前商业模式[\[1\]][1]。

不过，区块链技术仍处于早期阶段。与任何新技术一样，它本身存在缺陷，其中包括：有限的应用和不发达的治理机制。目前这些缺陷使区块链难以支持真实世界的分布式业务协作。 Hyperledger Fabric和R3 Corda等联盟链和Ethereum企业联盟等组织试图解决这些性能和治理问题，使区块链技术更适合企业。但如今，大财团和大型企业公司主导着联盟链技术。此外，他们的关闭式连锁治理模式效率非常低。没有令人信服的经济学模型以及公共链中的开放性和激励性，联盟链也被视为缺乏活力。

我们希望发展目前的区块链技术，并使成千上万的中小企业（“SMB”）甚至个人自由业务服务提供商能够在开放网络中提供服务并享受奖励。 为了实现这一目标，我们明确以下挑战以及随之而来的技术创新机会：

**并非所有计算都可以或应该以智能合约链上计算的形式实现**

以太坊提供的 [图灵完备](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness)虚拟机 [[2]][2]运行智能合约给了人们开发分散式应用程序的诸多希望。 然而，智能合约只能处理确定性逻辑（因此每个节点在处理完每个事务和块后都能达到相同的状态），而大量现有的业务逻辑不确定，并且可能在不同的时间和不同的环境参数下变化。 尤其是如今，业务系统越来越依赖计算机算法，包括自然语言处理（“NLP”），机器学习和操作研究算法，以便进行决策优化。 在这些算法中，我们经常故意添加一些随机性来决定不要陷入局部最优状态，也试图找到更好的次优结果。

另一方面，一些真实世界的业务逻辑应该在链下时运行，不应该作为这种类型的复制计算的智能合约来执行。 利用分布式账本整合和管理离线服务和资源是进一步推动采用区块链技术以实现更多实际应用场景的关键。

**如何利用现有的区块链资源，包括公有链和联盟链**

使用一个公共链来解决所有用例是不可行的。每天都有不同的区块链上线，侧重于一个方面解决问题，如分布式存储，资产所有权或预测市场等。根据coinmarketcap.com，有超过1000个加密货币目前在各种交易所上交易。

虽然构建业务应用程序涉及处理存储以及不同数据源的来源。 我们工作的另一个动机涉及如何通过分布式存储（IPFS，SIA，Storj.io等），数据发送（Augur，Gnosis，Oraclize等）和物联网（IOTA等）等现有工作来支持构建分布式业务应用程序。由这些专用区块链提供，而不是从头开始。

此外，还有很多（近）实时业务交易确实需要更密切的联盟链/许可链/私有链来解决性能问题，安全问题和业务治理要求。 我们关于分布式业务基础架构的需求需要具备异构链的交互操作性，包括公共链/联盟链/许可链/私有链。

跨链技术是对这一要求的一种非常直白的决解方案。 然而，直到今天，现有的跨链技术主要是为了提供现有区块链之间的互操作性，并专注于通证值转移。 如何消费不同链中提供的资源的问题仍然未得到解答。

比较现有的跨链技术如Cosmos [\[3\]][3] 和 Polkadot[\[4\]][4]，我们发现Cosmos提供了更成熟的
互操基础和可扩展性。 尤其是Cosmos提供了一个非常合适的架构，用于以SOC方式应对现实世界的复杂性，"`多枢纽和多分区`"的设计和“`每个分区都是独立的区块链，具有独立的治理模型`”。 为了最好地重用现有的框架，我们提出了IRIS网络，它是由枢纽和分区组成的一个分布式的跨链网络，基于Cosmos / Tendermint [\[5\]][5]实现，具有更为完善的通证使用。

由于IRIS网络基于Cosmos / Tendermint设计，我们将首先讨论Cosmos / Tendermint，总结我们从Cosmos / Tendermint继承的特性和独特的创新。

### Cosmos 和 Tendermint

Cosmos[\[3\]][3]打算建立“区块链互联网”。 它是许多独立区块链的网络，称为“分区”。 每个区域都由经典的拜占庭容错（“BFT”）共识协议（如Tendermint）提供支持。
Tendermint提供了一个高性能、一致、安全的BFT共识引擎，严格的分叉问责保证能够控制恶意行为者的行为。 Tendermint非常适合应用于扩展异构区块链，包括公有链，如Ethermint [\[6\]][6]。这是一次以太坊POS机制的快速实现，也是性能严格的许可链 /联盟链。 使用Tendermint在许可/联盟链域中的成功案例包括Oracle  [\[7\]][7]，CITA [\[8\]][8] 和Hyperledger Burrow  [\[9\]][9]。
Tendermint用于在Cosmos枢纽上构建第一个区域的共识协议。 集线器可以连接到许多不同类型的区域，通过区块链间通信（“IBC”）协议实现通信，这种协议是一种用于区块链的虚拟UDP或TCP。 通证可以安全地通过Cosmos枢纽从一个区域转移到另一个区域，而不需要分区之间的交换或受信任的第三方。
为了用Cosmos枢纽开发强大的可互操作区块链和区块链应用程序，Cosmos SDK提供区块链开发的常用区块链模块的“入门套件”，同时不强制附带应用限制，从而最大限度地为应用程序定制提供灵活性。

### IRIS 技术创新

IRIS网络旨在建立技术基础，以促进分布式商业应用的构建。 它有希望超越了现有专注于数字资产的区块链系统。
通过IRIS网络解决的关键问题是双重的：
- 分布式账本上的离线计算和资源的整合与协作;
- 跨异构链的服务互操作性。

我们通过将面向服务的基础架构纳入Cosmos / Tendermint来应对这些挑战。

我们的设计继承了多年来面向服务架构（“SOA”）实践的思维模式。 SOA是一种架构方法，用于创建由具有明确界限，共享架构和契约的自治服务构建的系统[[13]] [13]。早期的SOA实践侧重于实施企业服务总线（“ESB”），该服务通过公共通信总线实现服务之间的通信，该通信总线由供应商和消费者之间的各种点对点连接组成。但是，通过ESB集中管理服务可能会触发单点故障，也会增加服务部署的依赖性。最近大量的微服务架构风格可以被看作是SOA的发展，而不关注ESB，而是使用轻量级消息队列进行服务间通信。在IRIS网络中，互通服务通信旨在通过区块链实施，以利用区块链作为调解业务协作的可信机器。它在没有服务提供商和服务消费者之间现有信任的前提下运行，但是这种信任很难建立。

IRIS网络使用Tendermint协议作为高性能共识引擎。利用由Tendermint的区块链应用接口（“ABCI”）提供的灵活性，我们定义了一组服务基础交易类型，包括：服务供应，服务消费和服务管理。如前所述，大多数业务逻辑不适合作为区块链上的确定性智能合约来实施，我们正在使用此服务层将业务应用程序特定的逻辑和事务处理从区块链本身移开，并仅使用区块链就结果达成一致通过这些服务生成。这个想法也受到来自区块链社区的已有成果的启发，当解决主链中一些复杂计算的地址性能问题时，如Lightning Network的离线状态通道[\[10\]] [10]以及Plasma的防欺诈侧链[11] [11]。尽管我们没有实施侧链，但是我们将传统业务逻辑计算从区块链中剥离出来，并将其用作复杂业务协作的可信中介总线。

对于跨链通信，Cosmos IBC [\[12\]] [12]定义了用于将价值从一个链上的帐户转移到另一个链上的帐户的协议。 IRIS网络设计新的语义，以允许利用IBC调用跨链计算资源。 我们认为这种能力在构建可扩展的业务应用程序时非常重要。 下面列出了潜在用例的更多细节。

IRIS网络旨在提供服务基础架构，以处理和协调链上数据处理和业务逻辑执行的链下事务处理。 如果需要，扩展的IBC功能允许那些脱链处理被调用交叉链。 目前设想的IRIS网络还将包括客户端工具，包括支持跨链多资产存储的智能钱包，以及消费和提供`iServices`。 我们计划提供SDK以轻松构建`iServices`。 例如，对于特定的服务定义，客户端SDK将生成主要编程语言的提供者端框架以及消费者端组建。

<div STYLE="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## IRIS 网络设计

![img](https://github.com/irisnet/irisnet/blob/master/images/chap2-1.png?raw=true)

如上图所示，IRIS网络设计为与Cosmos网络有相同的拓扑结构。 我们计划将IRIS枢纽连接到Cosmos 枢纽作为其分区和二级枢纽之一。 IRIS将开发的IRIS全节点（IRIS SDK将扩展Cosmos SDK的功能），旨在提供服务基础设施并提供与星际文件系统（“IPFS”）节点集成。

IRIS服务（又名“iServices”）打算通过配置连线服务完整生命周期，从服务的定义、绑定（提供商注册）、调用，到他们的治理（分析和争端解决），连接区块链世界和传统的商业应用。 通过优化的IBC处理逻辑以支持服务语义，IRIS SDK旨在允许分布式商业服务在区块链互联网上可用。

尽管IRIS网络专注于为分布式业务应用提供创新解决方案，但它仍是Cosmos网络的一部分。 连接到IRIS枢纽的所有分区都可以通过标准IBC协议与Cosmos网络中的任何其他分区进行交互。 此外，通过引入服务语义层可以实现一套全新的业务场景。新一代的IRIS网络将增加Cosmos网络的规模和多样性。

### 网络参与者

1. **消费者** 是那些通过向网络发送请求并从网络接收响应来消费连锁服务的用户。

2. **提供商** 是那些可能提供一个或多个iService定义的实现的用户，并且经常在其他公共和联盟以及企业遗留系统中充当消费链服务和资源的适配器。提供者监视和处理传入的请求，并将响应发送回网络。提供者可以同时通过向其他提供者发送请求来充当消费者。按照计划，供应商将被要求为他们可能提供的任何服务收取费用，而服务费用，在默认情况下，将在IRIS 网络的本地收费令牌中定价，称为“iGas”;供应商也可以将他们的服务提供给其他的白名单，以便在适当的时候被考虑。
3. **分析员** 是代表IRIS 基金有限公司(“基金会”)的特珠用户，该基金会是一家香港注册有限公司担保。该基金会将率先建立IRIS网络。profiler是授权在profiling模式中调用iServices的唯一用户，旨在帮助创建和维护消费者用来选择合适的提供者的客观提供者配置文件。

### IRIS 服务

在本节中，我们列出了在IRS网络上部署iService的预期技术参数。

**服务定义**

一个`方法`的组成 :

- `ID(int)`：包含iService中该方法的唯一标识
- `名称（字符串）`：iService中此方法的唯一名称
- `描述（字符串）`：这种方法的描述
- `输入（字符串）`：输入参数的结构化定义
- `输出（字符串）`：输出结果的结构化定义
- `错误：（字符串）`：所有可能的错误条件的结构化定义
- `输出的隐私`：可以是`没有隐私`或者`加密的公钥`


A `ServiceDefinition` is composed of:

- `Name (string)`: The name of this iService
- `Description (string)`: A description of this iService
- `Tags (string)`: Comma separated keywords about this iService
- `Creator (string)`: A self-description of the iService creator. *Optional*
- `ChainID (string)`: The ID of the blockchain where this iService wasoriginally defined
- `Messaging (enum)`: Can be one of `Unicast` or `Multicast`
- `Methods ([]Method)`: The definition of methods available in this iService

A `CreateServiceDefinitionTx` transaction is composed of:

- `Definition (ServiceDefinition)`: The service definition to be created

**Service Binding**:

A `CreateServiceBindingTx` transaction is composed of:

- `DefinitionHash ([]byte)`: The hash of the service definition that the provider is binding to
- `ChainID (string)`: The ID of the blockchain where the provider is connected
- `ProviderAddress ([]byte)`: The provider's blockchain address
- `BindingType (enum)`: Can be one of `Local` or `Global`; choose `Global` if aprovider wants the binding to be exposed to the rest of the world;otherwise, use `Local`
- `ProviderDeposit (int64)`: To create an effective binding, the providermust put down a deposit (in terms of IRIS token amount) that is greater thanthe value of the system parameter `MinProviderDeposit`; a larger depositmay imply more trustworthiness of the provider
- `ServicePricing (string)`: A structured definition of the service pricingmodel on a per method basis, including cost per call, volume discount,promotional terms etc.; service fee is by default listed in IRIS token butcould also be quoted in other whitelisted fee tokens.
- `ServiceLevel (string)`: A structured definition of service level theprovider agrees to bind himself to, in terms of response time,availability etc.
- `BindingExpiration (int64)`: The blockchain height where this bindingexpires; a negative number means "never expire"

An `UpdateServiceBindingTx` transaction is composed of:

- `DefinitionHash ([]byte)`: The hash of the service definition theprovider has bound to
- `ChainID (string)`: The ID of the blockchain where the provider isconnected
- `ProviderAddress ([]byte)`: The provider's blockchain address
- `ChangeSet (string)`: A structured definition of desired changes to anexisting binding identified by the preceding three fields

![img](https://github.com/irisnet/irisnet/blob/master/images/chap2-2.png?raw=true)

A provider can update `ServicePricing`, `ServiceLevel` and `BindingExpiration`at any time, but a small amount of their deposit will be slashed forchanging the latter two (specified by `ServiceLevelUpdateSlash` and`BindingExpirationUpdateSlash` respectively). Setting `BindingExpiration` toa height that is lower than the current height will be interpreted asinvalidating the binding immediately.

Updates to `ProviderDeposit` will always be treated as *adding to* thecurrent deposit balance. Whenever the balance drops below`MinProviderDeposit`, the binding will be disabled until the providerincreases the balance above the threshold. Upon expiration orinvalidation of a binding, the provider will automatically get back theremaining balance of its deposit.

`BindingType` can be changed from `Local` to `Global`, but not the other wayaround. To downgrade a binding from `Global` to `Local`, a provider mustfirst invalidate the binding in question and then create a new `Local`binding.

If a provider somehow needs to move the binding to a new address, it isnot allowed to update `ProviderAddress` directly; instead, the providershould invalidate the current binding and create another one with thedesired new `ProviderAddress`.

Upon successful execution of these two transactions by the application(i.e., iService business logic in the IRIS SDK), a `ServiceBinding` objectwill be created or updated accordingly.

A `ServiceBinding` is composed of:

- `DefinitionHash ([]byte)`
- `ChainID (string)`
- `ProviderAddress ([]byte)`
- `ServiceLevel (string)`
- `ServicePricing (string)`
- `BindingExpiration (int64)`
- `IsValid (enum)`: Can be one of `True` or `False`

**Service Invocation**

![img](https://github.com/irisnet/irisnet/blob/master/images/chap2-3.png?raw=true)

Consumers and providers are proposed to interact with each other through *endpoints*.There are two kinds of endpoints -- *request table* and *response table*(see Figure above). Service requests are posted to request tables monitoredby interested provider(s) which pick up and process requests addressedto them; service results (or errors) are posted back to response tablesmonitored in turn by matched consumers.

For a `Multicast` service, all of its bindings share one request table;for a `Unicast` service, however, a separate request table is created andmaintained for each of its bindings. As for the other direction, a dedicated response table would be created and managed for each consumer.

A `ServiceRequest` is composed of:

- `ChainID (string)`: The ID of the blockchain where the consumer isconnected
- `ConsumerAddress ([]byte)`: The blockchain address of the consumer
- `DefinitionHash ([]byte)`: The hash of the service definition
- `MethodID (int)`: The ID of the method to be invoked
- `InputValue (string)`: A structured representation of input values
- `BindingHash ([]byte)`: The hash of the target binding, in case of a`Unicast` service. *Optional*
- `MaxServiceFee (int64)`: The max amount of service fee the consumer iswilling to pay for a `Multicast` request. *Optional*
- `Timeout (int)`: The max number of blocks the consumer is willing to waitfor response(s) to come back

A `PostServiceRequestTx` transaction is composed of:

- `Requests ([]ServiceRequest)`: The service requests to be posted
- `RequestDeposits ([]int64)`: The consumer must put down for each requesta deposit (in terms of IRIS amount) that is greater than the value of`MinRequestDeposit`; this deposit is meant to incentivize the consumer to acknowledge receipt of service responses in a timely manner (see `ConfirmServiceResponseTx`).

The application will verify that each request is coming from a consumerwith matching `ChainID` and `ConsumerAddress`, the targeted binding isvalid, the request deposit is sufficient, the consumer's account balance isenough to cover the request deposits and service fees, and that the totalnumber of requests in the transaction is less than `MaxRequestPostBatch`.

When a verified request is appended to the request table, the relatedservice fee (`MaxServiceFee` in case of a `Multicast` request) will bededucted from the consumer's account and locked up in escrow.

A `GetServiceRequest` query is composed of:

- `DefinitionHash ([]byte)`: The hash of the service definition
- `BindingHash ([]byte)`: The hash of this provider's binding to theservice in question; the application will verify that the binding isvalid and the caller matches the binding's `ChainID` and `ProviderAddress`
- `BeginHeight (uint64)`: The blockchain height from where the applicationshould start to retrieve requests for the provider, up to a total numberthat is the lesser of `BatchSize` and `MaxRequestGetBatch`
- `BatchSize (int)`: The max number of requests to be returned

A `ServiceResponse` is composed of:

- `RequestHash ([]byte)`: The hash of the matched request
- `BindingHash ([]byte)`: The hash of this provider's service binding
- `OutputValue ([]byte)`: A structured (potentially encrypted)representation of output result. *Optional*
- `ErrorMsg (string)`: A structured representation of error messages.*Optional*

A `PostServiceResponseTx` transaction is composed of:

- `Responses ([]ServiceResponse)`: The service responses to be posted

The application will verify that each response is coming from aprovider with matching `ChainID` and `ProviderAddress`, and that the numberof responses in the transaction is less than `MaxResponsePostBatch`. Averified request will be appended to the response table for the intendedconsumer.

A `GetServiceResponse` query is composed of:

- `RequestHash ([]byte)`: The hash of the original request; theapplication will verify that the caller matches the request's `ChainID`and `ConsumerAddress`
- `BeginHeight (uint64)`: The blockchain height from where the applicationshould start to retrieve responses for the consumer, up to a totalnumber that is the lesser of `BatchSize` and `MaxResponseGetBatch`
- `BatchSize (int)`: The max number of responses to be returned

A `ConfirmServiceResponseTx` transaction is composed of:

- `ResponseHash ([][]byte)`: The hash of responses to be confirmed

The application will verify that the each response to be confirmed isindeed for a request originated by the caller, and that the number ofresponses in the transaction is less than `MaxResponseConfirmBatch`.

Responses that fall out of the `Timeout` window (and, in case of `Multicast`responses, when `MaxServiceFee` runs out as more responses come back) willnot be accepted by the application. A consumer starts processing a`Unicast` response immediately upon receiving it. However, for `Multicast`responses, a consumer will need to wait until the `Timeout` window elapses beforestarting to process all responses received, if any.

When a `Unicast` response is confirmed by the consumer, the associatedservice fee will be released from escrow to the matched provider account-- after a small tax (defined by `ServiceFeeTaxRate`) is deducted andadded to the *system reserve*; and the associated request deposit willbe returned to the consumer as well.

In the case of a `Multicast` request, the situation is a bit more complex:when a response is confirmed, only part of the request deposit isreturned to the consumer, in proportion to the response related servicefee vs `MaxServiceFee`; and after all responses are confirmed, theremaining escrow balance for the request will be returned to theconsumer.

If a request timeouts without seeing any response come back, theapplication will refund the associated balance held in escrow plus the requestdeposit, in full, back to the consumer. However, if the consumer doesnot confirm a response in time (before `ResponseConfirmTimeout` +blockchain height of the response), a small penalty (defined by`ResponseConfirmDelayPenaltyRate`) will be applied before the requestdeposit is refunded to the consumer, while the associated service feewill be released to the provider as usual.

**Dispute Resolution**

In any case where a consumer is unsatisfied with a service response, a mechanism should exist allowing the consumer to issue a complaint and consequently, to receive an acceptable solution to that complaint, without having to resort to a centralized authority such as the legal system.  Also, this mechanism should avoidintroducing subjective evaluation, which could be abused by either side.

The process to resolve a dispute that arises on the IRIS network resembles that of service invocation, except that a consumer sends a `Complaint` to the provider, and the provider responds with a `Resolution`.  These interactions are intended to happen through a pair of global endpoints known as *complaint table* and *resolution table*.

Under the present design for the IRIS network, a consumer deposit is required for filing a complaint.  Where a consumer does not confirm a resolution in a timely manner, a penalty will be deducted from this deposit.  Similarly, a provider's deposit will be partially slashed if he fails to respond to a complaint in a timely manner.

A `Complaint` is composed of:

- `ResponseHash ([]byte)`: The hash of the response in dispute
- `Problem (string)`: A description of the problem with the service response
- `PreferredDisposal (enum)`: Can be one of `Refund` or `Redo`

A Resolution is composed of:

- `ComplaintHash ([]byte)`: The hash of the matched complaint
- `Disposal (enum)`: Can be one of `Refund` or `Redo`
- `Refund (uint64)`: Service fee refund. *Optional*
- `OutputValue ([]byte)`: A structured (potentially encrypted)representation of output result. *Optional*

Our intended dispute resolution process, as outlined above, may not be legally binding.  Nonetheless, we believe that it will provide an efficient means of resolving common disputes on the IRIS network.

**Service Profiling**

Bootstrapping the iService ecosystem presents a few challenges.  A major challenge is finding a way to make it easy for consumers to discover suitable providers - consumers need performance metrics to evaluate and select a provider, yet without consumer usage no performance metrics will be available.

With the intention to solve this circular issue, we plan to introduce a profiling mechanism where a privileged system user, the profiler, invokes all the active services on a regular schedule.  This would leave objective performance data in the network (such as response time, availability, complaint handling etc.) that are useful for real consumers.

Service profiling calls would be exempt from service fees and consumerdeposits, but they would incur network transaction fees. These callswould originate from a few reserved addresses that are intended to be recognized and honored by the application.

Profiling activities would stay at a relatively stable level for new servicesand gradually decline for individual services as they start toattract real consumer calls, which is expected to generate more performance data on their own.

Transaction fees incurred during profiling would be paid out from the system reserve by default, and the Foundation reserve would step in if necessary.

**Query**

All the service related lifecycle objects described above can be queriedusing the ABCI Query interface [[3]][3]. These queries would be executed overthe Query connection and do not participate in the consensus process. Wehave already seen how `GetServiceRequest` and `GetServiceResponse` querieswork as part of the service invocation process.

Below is a non-exhaustive summary of our currently planned queries:

**Service Objects**

| Object                                   | Commonly Used Filters                                        | Authorization            |

### IBC Enhancement

在Cosmos上建立自己的服务基础架构有一个独特优势：*服务可以部署一次，并通过区块链互联网随时随地进行调用*。具体来说，我们的计划是完成以下内容：
1. 服务定义广播到IRIS网络中的每个区域；
2. 全局服务绑定广播到IRIS网络中的每个区域；
3. 针对远程提供商的服务请求或投诉被路由到提供商所连接的区块链；
4. 针对远程消费者的服务响应或决议被路由回到消费者所连接的区块链。

在处理一个`CreateServiceDefinitionTx`事务时，应用程序被设计为首先在本地验证和存储`ServiceDefinition`对象，然后创建一个`IBCPacket`，`IBCPacket`中包含对每个相邻链的定义。
每个邻居最终从相应的中继过程中接收包含该分组的`IBCPacketTx`；如果该定义在接收链中不存在，则后者将通过为它每个邻居创建一个`IBCPacket`来传递这个定义—除了最初收到数据包的源链外；如果该定义已经存在，接收链将停止传递此定义。
同样，当利用`BindingType`集合创建或更新`ServiceBinding`或者更新到`Global`时，为每个相邻链创建一个数据包包含绑定的`IBCPacket`，并在整个IRIS网络中进行广播。

上述`IBCPacket`由以下部分组成：

- `头部 (IBCPacketHeader)` ：数据包头部
- `有效负载（ServiceDefinition或ServiceBinding）`：服务定义或绑定所用的字节数

前面提到的`IBCPacketHeader`由以下部分组成：

- `SrcChainID（string）`：创建此数据包的区块链的ID号
- `DstChainID（string）`：此数据包将派往的相邻区块链的ID号
- `Number（int）`：数据包对应的唯一编号
- `Status（enum）`：NoAck
- `Type (string)`：“iris-service-definition”或者是“iris-service-binding”

现在让我们来看看如何通过IBC发生链间服务调用。当请求一个Unicast服务时，应用程序检查目标绑定是否是本地（Local）的，如果是本地的（Local）则将`ServiceRequest`附加到相应的请求表中，如2.2所述；否则，将会创建一个包含`ServiceRequest`的`IBCPacket`。

包含一个ServiceRequest的`IBCPacket`由以下部分组成：
-  `头部（IBCPacketHeader）`：数据包的头部
-  `有效负载（ServiceRequest）`：服务请求的字节数


The `IBCPacketHeader` above is composed of:

- `SrcChainID (string)`: The ID of the blockchain creating this packet
- `DstChainID (string)`: The ID of the neighboring blockchain this packet isdestined for
- `Number (int)`: A unique number for all packets
- `Status (enum)`: `NoAck`
- `Type (string)`: "iris-service-definition" or "iris-service-binding"

前面提到的`IBCPacketHeader`由以下部分组成：

- `SrcChainID（string）`：创建此数据包的区块链的ID号
- `DstChainID（string）`：远程提供商所在的区块链的ID号，即ServiceRequest，ServiceBinding，ChainID
- `Number（int）`：数据包对应的唯一编号
- `Status（enum）`：AckPending
- `Type（string）`：“iris-service-request”
- `MaxHeight（int）`：当前高度加上ServiceRequest.Timeout

Now let's take a look at how interchain service invocation happens through IBC.When a request is made for a `Unicast` service, the application checks ifthe target binding is `Local`; where this is true, the `ServiceRequest` is appended to the corresponding request table as explained in 2.2; otherwise, an`IBCPacket` containing the `ServiceRequest` will be created instead.

An `IBCPacket` containing a `ServiceRequest` is composed of:

- `Header (IBCPacketHeader)`: The packet header
- `Payload (ServiceRequest)`: The bytes of the service request

The `IBCPacketHeader` above is composed of:

- `SrcChainID (string)`: The ID of the blockchain creating this packet
- `DstChainID (string)`: The ID of the blockchain where the remote provideris located, i.e., `ServiceRequest.ServiceBinding.ChainID`
- `Number (int)`: A unique number for all packets
- `Status (enum)`: `AckPending`
- `Type (string)`: "iris-service-request"
- `MaxHeight (int)`: Current height + `ServiceRequest.Timeout`

As a remote request finally arrives at the destination chain, theapplication would append it to the corresponding endpoint (the request table)for the targeted binding. A response to this remote request would bewrapped in a receipt `IBCPacket` that is routed all the way back to thesource chain and appended to the remote endpoint (the response table) forthe originating consumer.

Request for a remote `Multicast` service is treated in the same way exceptthat more than one `IBCPacket` could be generated in the source chain.

Remote complaints and resolutions are expected to work in the same manner as requests and responses, and therefore will not be elaborated here.

Below is a complete list of application-dependent `IBCPacket` types:

| **Type**                  | **iService Object** |
| ------------------------- | ------------------- |
| "iris-service-definition" | ServiceDefinition   |
| "iris-service-binding"    | ServiceBinding      |
| "iris-service-request"    | ServiceRequest      |
| "iris-service-response"   | ServiceResponse     |
| "iris-complaint"          | Complaint           |
| "iris-resolution"         | Resolution          |

## Use Cases

In this section, we have set out some potential use cases for the IRIS network.

### Distributed AI for privacy preserving data analysis

The proposed service infrastructure has been prototyped by Bianjie AI, aShanghai based startup, into its permission product `BEAN (BlockchainEdge Analytics Network)` to solve the longstanding challenge of gettingdata for running analytics models. Although homomorphic encryption isone of the key methods allowing computing to be achieved over encrypted data, it is said to be unable to practically solve real world machine learning problems due to its slow performance. As a result, BEAN was created to take a different approach. This approach uses the idea of model parallelism taken from the traditional distributed AI study [[14]][14] andutilizing SOA design patterns to develop distributed analytics services as an additional layer to the blockchain.

To protect data access, the (partial) model that runs on the data side needs to be open sourced to the client and specified in the service definition. Since only the partial model is released to the client, the model developers do not have to worry about someone stealing their idea; equally, the data owners never need to worry about losing control of data usage as their data will not be leaving its origin.

Other potential benefits could include the following:

1. Only a small amount of parametric data being exchanged on-chain, which can help enhance performance.

   .	A more practical way for data usage auditing, which is often needed in the healthcare domain.

Healthcare data is highly private, involving numerous security requirements. This puts forward the challenge for healthcare data to be used for the purposes of cross-organization collaboration (such as a cross-hospital clinic records search for diagnosis assistance, new drug clinic test patient identification, health insurance automatic claim processing etc.). This minimum viable product ("MVP") service layer implementation is built on top of `Ethermint` in attempt to connect hospitals, insurance companies and analytics service providers to provide privacy preserving healthcare data analytics capability.

Smart contracts have been implemented to support on-chain service registration and invocation. One example of the off-chain data processing could be to support a Diagnosis Related Group ("DRG") grouping analytics service. More specifically, when a hospital user invokes the DRG service, the raw medical record is processed off-chain using service provider provided client side NLP (implemented as SQL and Python) code stub to exact structured data inputs for receiving DRGs service over blockchain without passing the highly confidential raw medical records.

The `BEAN`scenario demonstrates a more complicated service use case includingimplementing distributed analytics, and connecting service providers aswell as service consumers, utilizing blockchain to provide audibletransaction ledge as well as trustworthy distributed computingfoundation.

### Data and analytics e-marketplace

From studying several proposed AI+Blockchain projects, it seems that most of the projects aim to provide data exchange markets and analytics API markets. With proposed `IRIS` infrastructure, thosenetworks could potentially be built with ease through publishing data as data services and wrapping analytics API as analytics services utilizing the `IRIS` service provider SDK.

### Distributed e-commerce

With the proposed `IRIS` infrastructure, integration with traditional systemslike `ERP` to obtain inventory information, or inter-chain query on trusted data sources to obtain information such as transportation and weather data, will be quite similar to the approach with which many enterprise application developers are already familiar. With those services integrated to supportdistributed e-commerce applications, it could be possible for distributed e-commerce applications to provide a similar user experience as centralized systems, such as Amazon or Alibaba.

### Combining public chains & consortium chains

For many business scenarios, taking a hybrid architecture of combining the good features of a public chain and a consortium chain can provide beneficial results, particularly with regards to performance, security and economic incentives.

For example, hospitals and insurance companies could form a consortium blockchain to support high performance medical insurance transactions, whilst identifying other information such as statistics regarding certain diseases as a global service, which can be invoked from other public chains. The tokens received from public chains can be awarded back tothose information providers in the consortium chain, which motivate thesystem participants to improve and promote services. With this infrastructure provided by `IRIS`, large-scale spontaneous collaboration could be made possible while still supporting stringent performance and security requirements.

There are many use cases that could be supported by the `IRIS` serviceinfrastructure, such as more efficient asset based security systems,distributed regulation technology such as due diligence, mutual aidmarketplace etc. One of `IRIS` project plans is also working closely withsuch application project teams to support and enable them with neededblockchain infrastructure and allow them to focus on delivering theenvisioned business value more efficiently.

## Token Economics

Similar to the Cosmos Network, the IRIS network, as presently designed, is intended to support a multi-token model. The tokens will be held on the various zones, and can be moved from one zone to another via the IRIS Hub. There are two types of tokens that are expected to support IRIS network's operation:

- staking token
- fee token

### Staking token

Adopting the same staking mechanism design used in the Cosmos network [[15]][15], the IRIS Hub will have its own special native token for staking. This token will be called "IRIS". We have a number of ideas in mind regarding the specific functionality of the IRIS token, including:

- integration of the IRIS token in the IRIS network's consensus engine validators, through a system of validators and delegators;
- voting power to participate in the IRIS network's governance

### Fee token

There are two types of fee tokens in IRIS network:

- **Network fee** token is for spam-prevention and payment to validators in maintaining theledger;
- **Service fee** token is used for payment to service providerswho deploy iServices and the default payment service token is IRIS token.

The IRIS network is intended to support all whitelisted fee tokens from the Cosmos network, e.g [Photon](https://blog.cosmos.network/cosmos-fee-token-introducing-the-photon-8a62b2f51aa), plus the IRIS token.

Supporting a variety of whitelisted fee tokens is a feature that we plan to adopt from Cosmos. It can provide an enhanced experience for network participants. In Cosmos, for `network fee token`, each validator has a configfile defines his personal weighting of how much they value each feetoken. Validator can run a separate cron job to update the config filebased on validator preferred live market data or maybe just use adefault config value.

For the `service fee token` design, similarly a multi-token model is planned to be supported.  A service provider on the IRIS network should therefore have the freedom to charge for their services in their preferred tokens, provided that it appears on the whitelist.

To help IRIS network participants mitigate cryptocurrency price volatility, the Foundation intends to facilitate the deployment of global iServices for retrieving market data from different exchanges, or through the potential introduction of oracles.

Both staking and fee tokens are subject to further refinement to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory obligations.

<div STYLE="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Initial Token Distribution

On Genesis, the initial token supply will be 2,000,000,000 IRIS tokens.  The distribution of IRIS tokens is planned to be as follows:

- **Private Sale**: 20%
- **Core Developer Team**: 20% (locked up for 6 months starting from IRIS Hub launch, followed by a linear monthly release for 2 years afterwards)
- **IRIS Foundation**: 15% (reserved to support the operations of the Foundation)
- **Ecosystem Development**: 45% (swap with zones connecting to IRIS Hub; grant to potential users; awards to outstanding partners)

If and when the IRIS network is fully deployed, the annual inflation rate of IRIS tokens is expected to be 7% to 20%. The exact rate will be adjusted to account for the fact that a substantial portion of IRIS tokens in circulation may be voluntarily staked by participants to participate in the consensus engine.

Proceeds from the private sale of IRIS tokens will be used, first and foremost, for the development of the IRIS network. The planned usage distribution is as follows:

- **Foundation Operations**: 10% (including service providers and contractors fees, for example, auditing, consulting, legal and other third party fees, and other overheads)
- **Software Development**: 50% (including costs, fees and expenses directly attributable to the development of launch)
- **Developer Enablement**: 10% (including funding hackathons, awards to volunteers and training programs)
- **Research and Development Sponsorships**: 10% (including conference, research programs and university outreach)
- **Marketing and Promotion**: 20% (including business development, community programs and outreach, together with related travel, communication, publication, distribution and other expenses)

<div STYLE="page-break-after: always;"></div>
